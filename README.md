▛▚ Thanks for downloading! ▛▚

If you're reading this, you're one out of a rough personal estimate of 3 and a half people that will open this file.
This is BR-Apollo, my passion project for over two years now. This started as a (very) short-lived custom texture pack attempt, but has grown into something bigger than I could ever have imagined.

▛▚ Installation instructions ▛▚

Download the file with the .pack extension from the BR-Apollo Github releases tab. Open your SFS game, navigate to the Modloader menu, click "Open Mods Folder." Once your file explorer opens, go through Custom Assets -> Parts, and drag in the .pack file. Relaunch the game, and BR-Apollo will be installed.


▛▚ USAGE GUIDELINES ▛▚

	Posting BR-Apollo online:

		I Highly doubt anybody will end up reading this, much less follow it, but here's what I would like to be included if you decide to make a post featuring my mod.

		Youtube:
		Please add link to my channel, the jmnet forum post, and the github repo. 
		Adding a link to the discord server would also be pretty cool, but that's a lot of links, you don't have to do that.
		Also, please mention my channel so I get a notification, I would love to watch!

		Instagram/Reddit:
		In the title/somewhere visible, put BR-Apollo mod by @briocheandthejets or u/BriocheRockets so I get to see the post!

		Discord:
		Just put my username and the name of the mod :)

		That being said, I don't really care too much what you put. If I see it, I'm just happy someone enjoyed my work.

	Creating an addon pack for BR-Apollo:

		Seeing as Eyes Turned Skyward and For All Mankind material will never be added to BR-Apollo, it's possible someone would want to create a ETS/FAM addon mod.
		If that person happens to be you, by all means, go ahead. Source code & prefabs are all open-source, so feel free to download them and take 'em apart.
		If you publish an addon mod, please follow this naming convention: "<mod name> - Addon for BR-Apollo"


	Stuff I just don't want to see done with my mod:

		Recreating tragedies, e.g. Apollo 1 pad fire. Just don't do this, please.
		The stack is recreatable with the Block 1 CSM parts and the Saturn IB, and is even showcased in the trailer for 1.1.
		This however, is, and should ONLY be used, to honor the mission that should have flown and NOT to recreate what eventually transpired at Pad 34.

	Do not use the source code whenever I push backups to download unreleased parts and release them. Not cool.
