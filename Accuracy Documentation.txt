Hello, Brioche here, creator of this part pack.

I am working incredibly hard to make this pack accurate, but due to SFS being two-dimensional, there are several liberties taken either to allow the parts to retain functionality, or because they were not possible in the part toolkit.
I have created this text file to document these inaccuracies and explain them, but of course, these are only the inaccuracies I know of because I made those liberties. If you see an inaccuracy not documented, that is a genuine mistake.
If you spot any of those, please contact me on the Spaceflight Simulator official discord or comment on the release YouTube video. I would love to hear and fix them!
Simplifications of details for texturing will not be included, neither will tiny greebling details, as those

Apollo Spacecraft

------------------------------

Command/Service Module:
1. Rotation of the spacecraft itself
My Saturn booster is modeled between Position II and III, with Fin B pointed towards the camera. IRL, the hatch of the CM would be on Position I, 225° clockwise (looking down from the top of the rocket) from where I have modeled it.
This change was mostly for aesthetics, just to provide a head-on spacecraft, although RCS was also a factor.

2. Lack of drogue chutes:
I wasn't able to find a way to add them accurately and in a way that was intuitive.

------------------------------

Lunar Module:
1. Lack of "front porch" and middle landing leg 
Addition of these details would be possible, but using the 2d animation system to create the animation would be incredibly difficult. These will likely never be added. Maybe if I get really really bored, though.

2. Spacecraft rotation
Inside the rocket, the hatch of the LM would face outward from Position III, 180° off of the CM's hatch, and 45° again clockwise of where I modeled it.
This is due to the both impracticality of operating, and the much much harder modeling of the LM from that angle, 45° rotated in a 2D space.

Saturn V

------------------------------

S-IVB:
1. Placement of ullage motors
On the real series 500 stages, the ullage motors would lie on Positions II and IV. I have them rotated 45° off to make them work in a 2d environment.

4. J-2 rotation
I don't want to create multiple parts for the same engine.

------------------------------

S-II:
2. J-2 rotation
I don't want to create multiple parts for the same engine.

------------------------------

S-IC:

2. F-1 insulation
Creative liberty to enable usage in custom builds. I'll add if I ever figure out toggling.

3. Lack of retrorockets on thrust structure
Difficulties with fragmentation behavior.
